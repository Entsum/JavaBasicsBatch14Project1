Type casting (Primitive data types):
	Type casting is converting one data type into another one.
	For example we can convert a short to byte and long to float etc.
	There are two main types Implicit/widening/automatic and explicit/narrowing/Manual and 
Implicit/widening/automatic type casting:
	When Java converts the data types automatically for us. 
	It only happens when we assign a smaller data type to a larger data type, 
	because there is no data lost in this conversion.

Explicit/narrowing/Manual casting:
	When we convert a larger data type to a smaller data type it is called
	Explicit/narrowing/Manual. I doesn't happen automatically. We have to do it explicitly Manually.
Why we should learn type casting?
	When we write code in our real life most of the time we use the code from others to save time
	from others to save time and we might might also need to convert the data types to make
	our code compatible with their code.
What is the syntax of type casting?
	We use () and inside the () we write the destination data type example if we want to convert a long to an int this is how we do it.
	long var1=250;
	int var2=(int)var1; // it is Explicit/narrowing/Manual
	double var3=var2 //Implicit/widening/automatic
	float f=250.5f;
	double d=f; // Implicit/widening/automatic

I else conditions
	If else conditions help us write code that can take the decision base on data.
Why should we learn about If else conditions?
	Because when we are solving a real life problem like testing a Web site our 
	Programs need to make a lot of decisions.
	If (the given user name and password matches)
	{go to home page} ELSE {given user a warning}	
	if (video freezing) {
	System.out.println(“Stop video”)}
	{else
	System.out.println(“Keep Video”}
What is the syntax for If else conditions
	boolean isHungry=true;
	if (isHungry){
	System.out.println("Please eat something");
	}ELSE{
	System.out.println("Lets build so java programs");
	}
